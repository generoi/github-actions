# Helper functions for composer-update/scripts/update.sh.
#
# Sourced by update.sh (and by the unit tests under ../tests). These functions
# are pure-ish: they take args and read a few tempfiles that update.sh writes
# before calling them:
#   /tmp/composer-update-constraints.json  (build_pkg_arg, build_widen_arg)
#   /tmp/composer-update-direct.txt         (find_direct_ancestors, expand_args_for)
#   /tmp/composer-update-reverse.txt        (find_direct_ancestors)
#   /tmp/composer-update-vulns.json         (is_still_vulnerable)
# and $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH for the PHP helpers.

# Build the composer arg for a single package: just the name if no
# constraint is configured for it, or `name:constraint` (e.g.
# `vendor/pkg:~1.2.3`) when the caller supplied a tight bound.
# Tilde at offset >0 inside a single word isn't subject to shell
# tilde expansion, so the colon-form is safe to interpolate.
# Trailing newline matters: expand_args_for() concatenates this
# with find_direct_ancestors() and pipes the result to `while read`;
# without it, a direct-dep package produces an unterminated line
# that `read` discards and the arg ends up empty. (#27)

# Build the composer arg for the WIDEN step (composer require), which
# REPLACES the project's constraint rather than tightening within it.
# Here the package gets a caret `^min_safe` (e.g. `^27.1.2` =
# `>=27.1.2,<28.0.0`) instead of the patch-pinned tight `~min_safe`.
# Why: `composer require` is reached only when the in-constraint
# update already failed — i.e. the fix lives OUTSIDE composer.json's
# current constraint (e.g. project pins `^26.0` but the patched
# release is 27.x). A tight `~27.1.2` would (a) pin to a single patch
# line that often doesn't exist (Yoast went 27.1.1 → 27.2, no 27.1.2)
# and (b) defeat the whole point of widening. The caret spans the
# safe-version's whole major, so composer can land on the real fix
# (27.6) while still not crossing into the next major. Packages with
# no min_safe (no vulns_json) fall back to a bare name — unconstrained
# widening, as before. (#29)

# Why: `composer update -W X` updates X and X's dependencies (downward),
# but NOT X's reverse-deps. For metapackages like roots/wordpress that
# pin roots/wordpress-no-content at self.version, the parent is locked
# at the same version as the transitive and won't move unless we list
# it explicitly. Without this expansion, updating wordpress-no-content
# within a tight ~constraint fails with "roots/wordpress is locked and
# not requested" and falls through to widening — which then rewrites
# composer.json unnecessarily.
